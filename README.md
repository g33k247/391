# Linux
This repo supports my Linux courses. You'll find a number of free, curated resources that will help you on your Linux journey--whether you just want a cheatsheet for commands or you need supporting resources as you study for a certification exam.

This is your introduction in the study of Linux system administration. You will be able to configure, secure, manage users, and apply user- and host-based security to Linux systems. You will participate in lab simulation activities and evaluate system administration concepts as applied to a user base. The primary focus is to manage user and group resources, secure a workstation on a network, and start and stop Linux operating system services. Concepts learned will be directly applicable in the Linux system administration field. Your learning will also help you prepare for the LPI Linux Essentials and the CompTIA Linux+ certification exams.
