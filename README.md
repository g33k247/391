# 391
This repo supports my CMIT391 courses. You'll find a number of free, curated resources that will help you on your Linux journey--whether you just want a cheatsheet for commands or you need supproting resources as you study for a certification exam.

From my current syllabus: CMIT391 is an introductory course in the study of Linux system administration. By the completion of this course, you will be able to configure, secure, manage users, and apply user- and host-based security to Linux systems. You will participate in lab simulation activities and evaluate system administration concepts as applied to a user base. The primary focus is to manage user and group resources, secure a workstation on a network, and start and stop Linux operating system services. Concepts learned in this course will be directly applicable in the Linux system administration field. This class will also help you prepare for the CompTIA Linux+ certification exam.
